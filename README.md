## 🚀 About the Project

**TakeNote** is a minimalist web app where users can:
- 🧠 Write a **note title** and **content**
- ➕ Add notes to a list
- ❌ Delete notes from the list

This project was created as part of my Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp to gain hands-on experience with **React functional components** and **React Hooks**.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Learned

- ✅ `useState` — for managing stateful data in functional components
- ✅ `useEffect` — (if used/extended, e.g., for syncing with localStorage or debugging)
- ✅ Component structure and props
- ✅ Basic JSX and conditional rendering
- ✅ Styling with basic CSS
